# Arduino MATLAB serial communication

## Description 

This script was used to receive GPS data from an Arduino board in a computer using MATLAB, but it can be used to fetch data from any other serial connection.

The purpose was to plot the GPS positions in real time and save it in a log file using CSV format (separating variables using a comma delimiter).

## Requirements:

   * Data must be sent through Serial port.
   * Variables must be sent separated by a comma ',' with a carriage return and newline characters after the last variable. Example: Serial.println()
    


## Using with Arduino

To use it with an Arduino:
   - The Arduino board must be connected to the computer via USB port;
   - Data must be send using Serial.print() and Serial.println() functions.

### Example:

To send the following variables:

    Latitude = -401034;
    Longitude = -501343;
    RandomData = 12314;
    
Use:
 
```
Serial.print(Latitude)
Serial.print(",")
Serial.print(Longitude)
Serial.print(",")
Serial.println(RandomData)
```
